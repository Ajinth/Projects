This project contains my files for the Kaggle House Prices project (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). 

The 'Kaggle House Prices Competition Write-Up' notebook is a step-by-step overview of my process. Or you can simply load the final_model.py and feature_process_helper.py files to just run the model itself.
