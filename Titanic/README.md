This project contains my files for the Kaggle Titanic project (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). 

The 'Titanic Model Walk-Through' notebook is a step-by-step overview of my process. Or you can simply load the random_forest.py and feature_process_helper.py files to just run the model itself.  

You can also read the write-up (and provide feedback) on my website: https://zlatankr.github.io/posts/2017/01/30/kaggle-titanic
