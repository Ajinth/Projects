PLAN OF ATTACK

Cross-Validation Approach:
- Nested k-fold cross-validation 
	- no need for test set

Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Gridsearch

Models:
- SVC (standardize)
- Random Forest (no need to standardize)
- KNN (standardize)
- Ensemble method
- AdaBoost

Model processing:
- Pipeline

Preprocessing:

- Each variable should be categorized as:
	- Keep as is:
		- Keep numeric columns with no nulls
		- Keep categorical columns with 10 or fewer unique values
	- Drop:
		- Drop anything with more than 20% nulls
		- Drop meaningless columns (such as ID)
	- Transform numeric columns:
		- Impute missing values (check for zeros)
		- Change date columns to months (or quarters)
			- group like months together based on functionality
	- Transform categorical columns:
		- Combine categories based on functionality (min 70%), non-functionality (min 50%), needs repair (min 20%), or mixed. If new value from test set, set to mixed.
