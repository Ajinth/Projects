This project contains my files for the DrivenData Pump It Up project (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/). 

To obtain my final output file, first load the data using the download_files.py file, then download feature_process_helper.py in order to be able to do the essential variable transformations, and lastly run the code in random_forest.ipynb.  

You can also read the write-up (and provide feedback) on my website: https://zlatankr.github.io/posts/2017/01/23/pump-it-up
