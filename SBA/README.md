This project contains my files for the Small Business Administration (SBA) project I'm working on with Code for San Francisco. 

The objective of the project is to use SBA loan data in order to identify overserved and underserved areas, as well as to highlight success stories.

Write-up coming once the project is complete.

Current output of the project is can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/zlatan.kremonic#!/vizhome/SBALoans_1/ZIP_Analysis
